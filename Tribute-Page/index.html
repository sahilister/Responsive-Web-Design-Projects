            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>
                Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011)[2] was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.

            <h2>Life in a Timeline</h2>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>  Sept 9, 1941 <h3>Birth </h3>
                    Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie born in Bronxville, New York.
                </li>

                <li>  1963 <h3> BS Degree from Harvard & Job at Multi timersharing Project </h3>
                    Recieved BS degree in Physics from Harvard. Ritchie had a part-time job at MIT Project MAC's Multics timersharing project.
                </li>
                
                <li>  1967 <h3> Hired at Bell Labs</h3> 
                    Joined Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center. Started working on Multics OS.
                </li>

                <li>  1968 <h3>PhD from Harvard, Start </h3>
                    Recieved PhD in Applied Mathematics from Harvard.
                </li> 
                
                <li>  1969 <h3> Bells Labs withdrew from Multics project </h3>
                    Bell Labs removes themselves from the Multics OS project that Ritchie and Thompson were working on. Ritchie aided Thompson in producing this single-memory OS.
                    Starts work on UNIX.
                    Ritchie noted:
                    <p><i>
                            "It began in 1969 when Ken Thompson discovered a little-used PDP-7 computer and set out to fashion a computing environment that he liked. Thompson wrote the first version of Unix for a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 in a month, using a cross-assembler that ran on GECOS. The PDP-7 he used had 4K of 18-bit words. His work soon attracted me; I joined in the enterprise, though most of the ideas, and most of the work for that matter, were his."
                    </i></p>
                </li>
                <li>  1971 <h3> UNIX Released</h3>
                    Ritchie and Thompson release the UNIX OS which derieves from Multics.Bell Laboratories Computing Sciences Research group ported Unix to a DEC PDP-11 to support text processing for the Bell Labs Patents Office.
                </li>
                <li>  1973 <h3> C language is Introduced</h3>
                    C language was created and was UNIX system was implemented in C.

                <li>  1982 <h3> IEEE Emanuel Piore Award</h3>
                    Ritchie and Thompson awarded IEEE Emanuel Piore Award for "the creation and development of an operating system of high utility, availability, and instructive value, as embodied in UNIX and its related facilities." 
                
                </li>
                <li>  1983 <h3> Recieved ACM A.M. Turing Award with Thompson</h3>
                    Recieved the ACM A.M. Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and the "Nobel Prize of computing" for their work in UNIX and general operating system.
                    The Turing Award selection committee wrote:
                    <p>
                        <i>
                            The success of the UNIX system stems from its tasteful selection of a few key ideas and their elegant implementation. The model of the Unix system has led a generation of software designers to new ways of thinking about programming. The genius of the Unix system is its framework, which enables programmers to stand on the work of others.
